<h4 id="section">1</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Treatment: <script type="math/tex">10/43 = 0.23 \rightarrow 23\%</script>. Control: <script type="math/tex">2/46 = 0.04 \rightarrow 4\%</script>.</li>
  <li>There is a 19% difference between the pain reduction rates in the two groups. At first glance, it appears patients in the treatment group are more likely to experience pain reduction from the acupuncture treatment.</li>
  <li>Answers may vary. Two possible answers:
  <script type="math/tex">^1</script>Though the groups’ difference is big, I’m skeptical the results show a real difference and think this might be due to chance. <script type="math/tex">^2</script>The difference in these rates looks pretty big, so I suspect acupuncture is having a positive impact on pain.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="section-1">4</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>The cases are 202 black and 504 white adults who resided in or near New York City, were ages 20-94 years, and had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m<script type="math/tex">^2</script>.</li>
      <li>The variables are <code>age</code> (numerical, discrete or continuous, depending on whether or not it’s recorded in years), <code>sex</code> (categorical), <code>ethnicity</code> (categorical), <code>weight</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>body_fat_percentage</code> (numerical, continuous).</li>
      <li>The research question was “How useful is BMI for predicting body fat percentage across age, sex and ethnic groups?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>The cases are 129 University of California at Berkeley undergraduates.</li>
      <li>The variables are social-class rank (categorical) and number of candies taken (numerical, discrete).</li>
      <li>The research question was “Is there a difference between the unethical behaviors of people who identify themselves as having low and high social-class rank?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="section-2">6</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Each row corresponds presumably to a UK resident.</li>
  <li>1691</li>
  <li><code>gender</code> is categorical; <code>age</code> is continuous; <code>marital</code>
is categorical; <code>grossIncome</code> is ordinal categorical; <code>smoke</code> is 
categorical; <code>amtWeekends</code> is numerical discrete; <code>amtWeekdays</code> is
numerical discrete. <strong>Note:</strong> Some of these are fuzzy, particularly the distinction between continuous and discrete numerical data.  If you are ever in doubt, make sure to clearly justify why you make the choice that you do.  Oftentimes, we are more interested in your thought processes than your specific choice.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="section-3">8</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The population of interest is all adults. The sample is the 202 black and 504 white men and women who resided in or near New York City and had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m<script type="math/tex">^2</script>.  The sample is voluntary so the results cannot be generalized to the population at large. Since it doesn’t appear to be representative of the population at large since the racial diversity of the subjects is limited. In addition, since the study is observational the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships (it also doesn’t appear that the researchers are trying to establish causation).</li>
  <li>The population is not defined but it’s likely intended to be all people. The sample is 129 UC Berkeley undergraduates. We are not told how the sample is collected, however, it is certainly not representative of the population at large since it consists only of undergraduate students at UC Berkeley. However, this is an experiment and, therefore, the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="section-4">10</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Percent with a Bachelor’s degree</em> is the explanatory variable and 
<em>Per capita income (in thousands)</em> is the response variable.</li>
  <li>There appears to be a positive linear relationship between the variables, with most of the data clustering at the lower values. There are a small number of counties with very high incomes and degree rates.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="section-5">16</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Non-responders may have a different response to this question. The parents who returned the surveys are probably those who do not have difficulty spending time with their kids after school. Parents who work might not have returned the surveys since they probably have a busier schedule.</li>
  <li>It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might be in a lower socio-economic status than the respondents.</li>
  <li>First, there is no control group in this study. It may be that if we looked at 30 patients with joint problems, 20 of them regularly go running as well. Second, this is an observational study. Third, there may be confounding variables. For example, these people may go running because they are generally healthier and/or do other exercises. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="section-6">22</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Experiment, since there is assignment of subjects into two groups</li>
  <li>The experimental group are those that were given chia seeds and the control
group are those that are given the placebo.</li>
  <li>Yes, researchers blocked on sex.</li>
  <li>If the placebo is indistinguishable from the chia seeds, then the subjects were blinded as to their assignment. It doesn’t specify if the researchers were
blinded.</li>
  <li>Because they used random assignment, a causal claim would be reasonable. It may be difficult to generalize to a broader population, however, since the subjects volunteered to take part and therefore differ from the population at large (say, by being healthier in general).</li>
