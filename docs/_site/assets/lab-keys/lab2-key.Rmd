#### Exercise 1: 

```{r ex1plots, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qplot(x = dep_delay, data = flights, geom = "histogram")
qplot(x = dep_delay, data = flights, geom = "histogram", binwidth = 15)
qplot(x = dep_delay, data = flights, geom = "histogram", binwidth = 150)
```

As `binwidth` goes from `default` to `15`, more granularity is seen and the pattern is more prominent.  As `binwidth` increases to `150`, some of the pattern is lost.

You can also change the `color` and `fill` of the bins as you wish:

```{r colorplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qplot(x = dep_delay, data = flights, 
  geom = "histogram",
  color = I("black"),
  fill = I("goldenrod"))
```


#### Exercise 2:

```{r filter_data}
pdx_flights <- filter(flights, origin == "PDX")
sfo_feb_flights <- filter(pdx_flights, dest == "SFO" & month == 2)
```

Use the command given to create `sfo_feb_flights`.  You could either use the `dim` function from Lab 1 or `summarise`/`summarize` in the `dplyr` package.

```{r get_count}
sfo_feb_flights %>% summarize(count = n())
```

There are `r dim(sfo_feb_flights)[1]` flights meeting this criteria.

#### Exercise 3:

```{r ex3plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qplot(x = arr_delay,
  data = sfo_feb_flights,
  binwidth = 50,
  color = I("black"),
  fill = I("red"))
```

The distribution of _arrival delays_ is right-skewed.  We should, therefore, use the median and IQR as summary statistics instead of measures like mean and standard deviation which are heavily influenced by outliers.

```{r ex3sum}
sfo_feb_flights %>% 
  summarize(media_ad = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    iqr_ad = IQR(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```


#### Exercise 4:

The data appears before the pipe symbol instead of the first argument in the `filter` function.  Additionally, the new piping syntax allows us to chain multiple functions together so we don't need to create the intermediate data frame of `pdx_flights` but instead pass the newly filtered data frame as the next argument to `summarise`.

#### Exercise 5:

```{r ex5}
sfo_feb_flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(median_ad = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            iqr_ad = IQR(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Based on the IQR values, `UA` (United Airlines Inc.) has the most variable arrival delays.

#### Exercise 6:

```{r ex6}
flights %>%
  filter(origin == "PDX") %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(mean_dd = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_dd = median(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_dd))
```

The month of December has the highest average (mean) departure delay.  It also has the highest median departure delay.  Since these distributions are very right-skewed, it makes more sense to use the median than the mean.  It appears that April had the best median departure delay with flights leaving four minutes early.

### On your own:

#### 1:

```{r oyo1}
flights <- flights %>% mutate(avg_speed = distance / (air_time / 60))
head(flights %>% select(avg_speed))
```

Note that you need to reassign `flights` after doing the mutation here.  Also note that you need to divide `air_time` by 60 to get units of mph.  The first few values of this new column are provided for reference, but are not required.

#### 2:

```{r oyo2}
flights %>% arrange(desc(avg_speed)) %>%
  select(avg_speed, tailnum)
```

The plane with the fastest `avg_speed` corresponds to `tailnum` N464AS.  Googling this `tailnum` yields that this is an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 [plane](https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/Boeing/737/40714/N464AS-Alaska-Airlines).

#### 3:

```{r oyo3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qplot(x = avg_speed,
  y = distance,
  data = flights,
  geom = "point"
  )
```

Average speed appears to be positively correlated with distance traveled, but the pattern does not appear to be linear.

#### 4:

```{r oyo4}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(max_dd = max(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    IQR_ad = IQR(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

This shows that Alaskan had the largest departure delay of almost 26 hours (1553 minutes), but Hawaiian had the largest IQR arrival delay.  

You could say a lot of other things here or just say what was actually calculated.  Either is really OK based on the problem statement.

#### 5:

```{r oyo5plot1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sub_flights <- flights %>% filter(carrier == "AA" | carrier == "DL" | carrier == "UA")
qplot(x = dep_delay,
  y = arr_delay,
  data = sub_flights,
  color = carrier)
```


```{r oyo5plot2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qplot(x = dep_delay,
  y = arr_delay,
  data = sub_flights,
  xlim = c(min(sub_flights$dep_delay), 50),
  ylim = c(min(sub_flights$arr_delay), 200))
```

Answers will vary here.  Based on this zoomed-in plot, it appears that flights are at around 50% for arriving on time at about 10 minutes of `dep_delay`.
